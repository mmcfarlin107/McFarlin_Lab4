    <h3> Shark Attack Frenzy </h3>

  <p>
     I recently went on a trip to feed sharks.  Everyone told me that it would be so much fun!
     When I get there everything was fine.  They put me in a safe cage, gave me food to feed the sharks,
     and said to “have fun.”
  </p>
  <p>
  I thought everything was going great until I dropped the food on the floor of the cage!
     The sharks all went crazy trying to attack me. Before I knew it, the bars were starting to dent… They pulled out
     out of the water just in time and we were safe!  I’ll tell you what though, that sure was an adventure!
   </p>
   <p>
     After the trip, we went to a seafood restaurant and I wanted to try the same type of fish the shark ate. I
     figured it must taste good if they liked it that much, and they sure did seem strong.  That food was terrible!
     I never really did like seafood much, but figured I would give it another shot.  I'll have to stick to my super
     basic vegitarian sushi again until futher notice.
   </p>
   <p> All in all, would I recommend this shark adventure?  The answer is "Yes."  Would I also recommend they store the food better?
     Yes, I would recommend that.  It was a great time and great story, but don't drop the shark food!
